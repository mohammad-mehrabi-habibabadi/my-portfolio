## 🔬 Research & Publications

### **Journal Article (In Preparation)**
**Comparative Analysis of Surrogate Models in Hydrogeology**
* **Authors:** Mehrabi Habib Abadi, M., & Raeisi Isa-Abadi, A.
* **Abstract:** This research aims to identify the most effective surrogate modeling technique, among Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Networks (NN), for predicting hydraulic head in heterogeneous unconfined aquifers.
* **Methodology:** A novel two-stage approach was employed where spatial topology was optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA). Based on these geometries, 1500 samples were generated via **COMSOL Multiphysics** parametric sweeps and trained in MATLAB.

### **Conference Papers (2018)**

**1. Dynamic analysis of bridge with and without considering the effect of pile**
* *4th International Conference on Civil Engineering, Architecture and Urban Planning (Shiraz, Iran)*
* **Abstract:** Modeled a bridge in **CsiBridge** software to evaluate dynamic response under seismic excitations. Results demonstrated that inclusion of piles significantly influences force distribution and displacement patterns.

**2. Response analysis of bridge by considering the effect of pile**
* *National Conference on Applied Researches in Structural Engineering (Tehran, Iran)*
* **Abstract:** Investigated dynamic behavior under moving dead loads and seismic loads. Results indicated that the presence of piles reduces axial and shear forces under dead loads while altering seismic response.
